socketmap-sqlite
================

A socketmap script wrapping an SQLite database.

Why?
====

I have a number of FreeBSD servers, with one intended to act as my primary
mailserver (the current one and remaining one becoming secondary mailservers).
The problem is that I'm using postfix, and trying very hard to stick to
precompiled packages rather than using ports, and postfix on FreeBSD lacks
bindings to databases. In my case, I wanted to be able to use an SQLite
database.

Configuration format
====================

Configuration files are INI files containing two types of section.

First is the ``[database]`` section, which gives database connection details.
This has one field, `path`, which gives the path to the SQLite database.
Example::

    [database]
    path = /path/to/sqlite.db

Other sections start wth ``table:``, and denote virtual tables to be queried.
There are two fields: `transform` (optional) and `query` (required).

The `transform` field gives the name of a transformation to apply to the query
parameter before its use in the query the query. The default is to accept the
parameter as-is (`all`). Other values can be a reference to a Python function
in the form 'module:function', `local` for just the local part, and `domain`
for the domain part of the address.

The `query` field give an SQL query to be urn to generate the synthetic table.
The value to be queried is given as a '?', which is the SQLite driver's
placeholder in prepared statements.

Usage
=====

Run with::

    socketmap-sqlite --config /path/to/config.ini

If you don't provide the `--config` flag, it defaults to
``/etc/socketmap-sqlite.ini``.

Postfix
=======

This script is intended to be executed by Postfix's spawn_ mechanism, meaning
it reads its input and writes its output to stdin and stdout respectively.

.. _spawn: http://www.postfix.org/spawn.8.html

Assuming you've installed the script in ``/usr/local/libexec``, add the
following to ``master.cf``::

    sockmapd  unix  -      -       n       -       1       spawn
      user=nobody argv=/usr/local/libexec/socketmapd-sqlite

Compatibility
=============

The script ought to work on Python 2.7, but only Python 3.3+ are supported.

.. vim:set ft=rst:
